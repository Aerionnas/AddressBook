# Final
Final Project for Computer Science 12b Spring 2018

Project Title: Address Book

Description: This is an Address Book GUI that enables the user to add people to
the address book along with their phone numbers and addresses. Once someone is
entered, it is saved into the AddressBookData.txt file. I created this file for
COSI class. The requirements for the project are in the Summary.txt file.

Languages used: Java(Object Oriented Programming and GUI)

This project utilizes five different files: Entry.java, AddressBook.java,
ActionListenerManager.java, AddressBookData.txt, and FinalProject.java.

Entry.java- This is a Entry class with attributes, getters, setters, and a toString
method. It contains the blueprint for Entry objects.

AddressBookData.txt -This txt file saves all the entries created by the user of
the GUI. It is updated each time the GUI runs.

AddressBook.java-This is where the GUI is actually created. Several Java Swing elements are included in this
project.

ActionListenerManager.java- This contains the code for the two main buttons:
addButton and searchButton. It call on several methods from the Entry class.

FinalProject.java-this contains the main method that runs this entire program.
In this file, a Map is created. This is where all of the entries are stored.
It also reads and writes to the text file.

Building this project, I face many challenges. The main challenge was getting use
to the Map interface because I never used it before.

To run this project, compile the FinalProject.java class and run it in the
terminal.
